Key Considerations
Monorepo Benefits:
A monorepo lets you share code easily between the website and web app (or even with AI services), reuse common components (e.g., design tokens, utility functions), and maintain consistency across your projects.

Separation of Concerns:

Website: Typically static or server-rendered content aimed at marketing, SEO, and branding.

Web App Frontend: The client-side application built with React (and styled with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, etc.).

Web App Backend: API server handling business logic, data persistence, and integration with external services (using Axios, React Query on the frontend, etc.).

Shared Packages:
The /packages folder can host libraries that are used across different parts of your system (e.g., custom UI components, shared TypeScript types, validation schemas with Zod). This reduces duplication and keeps your code DRY.

Tooling and Dependency Management:
Tools like Yarn Workspaces or pnpm can help manage dependencies across multiple projects in a monorepo. You can centralize configuration (like ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript settings) at the root to enforce consistency.

Scalability:
With this structure, you can scale each part independently. For example, you can deploy the website as a static site, run the web app's backend on a different server, and scale the AI services as needed.
